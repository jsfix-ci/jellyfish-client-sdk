      hash: 7cdb2d7e212a7d17b4d4dc998bb20b6aab3ec5ed
      body: |
        Previously, whenever `loginWithToken` was called, it would automatically
        refresh the token. This is quite resource intensive and has now been
        changed to the more lightweight approach of simply checking the current
        tokens expiration date.

        The global mask is a schema that will be applied to all subsequent
        queries. The global mask can be 'cleared' (unset) by setting it to
        `null`.


        You can also manually ignore the global query schema when calling
        `query()`, `view()` or `stream()` by passing `ignoreMask: true` in the
        `options` argument.

      hash: d6a012e749a2ee82c5d6ed61d1456e46849560e7
      body: >
        Loops will not be associated using links but with a top-level 'loop'
        field on each contract. This commit removes some link constraints that
        were recently added but are no longer appropriate. Although this
        constitutes a major bump there should be no problem with removing these
        link constraints as they were not being used yet.


        Note - there are still link-constraints defined between loops &
        contract-repository and loops & transformers. These will be removed at a
        later time once the code that relies on these links has been updated.
